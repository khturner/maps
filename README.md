# Interactive Maps
I've made many maps over the past couple of years, mostly with D3 and Python. I'll use this repository to start sharing them.

## Maps
* [2015 Chicago Municipal Elections](https://spencerchan.github.io/2015-chicago-municipal-elections.html) (D3/Leaflet)
* [Choropleth with selectable regions](https://spencerchan.github.io/selectable-regions.html) (D3/Leaflet)
