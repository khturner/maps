# Interactive Maps
This repository is for sharing maps I have created, mostly using D3 and Python.

## Maps
* [Chicago Municipal Elections](https://spencerchan.github.io/maps/chicago-municipal-elections.html) (D3/Leaflet)
  * Data scraped from Chicago Board of Election's website using this [Python script](https://github.com/spencerchan/chicago-elections-scraper).
* [Choropleth with selectable regions](https://spencerchan.github.io/maps/selectable-regions.html) (D3/Leaflet)
* [Nearest 'L' Station](https://spencerchan.github.io/nearest-L-station/index.html) (Leaflet)
	* Edge Network Voronoi diagram partitioning Chicago's walkable street network into "regions" consisting of all paths with a shorter walking distance to a particular 'L' station than any other. Be patient, as the map could take a couple of seconds to load and to zoom in and out.
